# An Elm-lang  Implementation of Robots

This is my go at the 'Robots' problem, which I've used as a kata to learn Elm.

# Requirements

1. Install Elm -> [https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html]
2. Clone this repo.
3. Run the 'elm-reactor' command line tool from the root directory
4. Browse to [http://localhost:8000/robots.elm]
